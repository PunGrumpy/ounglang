## üìú Introduction

Oung is a unique programming language inspired by the sound of seals. It features a minimalistic syntax and provides basic functionally for input/output, variable manipulation, and arithmetic operations.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

There is no separate installation required for **Oung**. You can directly complie and execute **Oung** programs using a [C compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/).

### Writing Code

To write a program in **Oung**, create a new text file with a `.oung` extension. You can use any text editor to write **Oung** code.

### Compiling Code

Complie your **Oung** code using a C compiler. For example, you can use `gcc` to compile your code.

```bash
cd interpreter/
gcc oung.c -o oung
```

Replace `oung.c` with the name of your Oung source file if it's different.

Execute your complied program to run it.

```bash
./oung example/hello.oung
```
